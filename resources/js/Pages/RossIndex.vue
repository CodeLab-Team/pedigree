                        Runa actively invests in OSS startups (like Nginx and MariaDB) and considers an active developer community to be instrumental for open-source businesses. We look for promising companies with a fast-growing army of fans, track them at Github, and decided to open-source our findings as an index.
                        ROSS index highlights top-20 open-source startups by the annualised growth rate (AGR) of Github stars at their repositories. While these stars are not a perfect metric for community evaluation, they allow us to understand which OSS products were on top of developersâ€™ mind last quarter. Our index is transparent, measurable and fully focused on startups.
